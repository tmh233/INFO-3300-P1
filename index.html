      <h3>Fewer songs/artists make big.</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>... the 60s saw the most fluent charts. In '67, <span class="song">827</span> different songs made it. That's more than double the measly <span class="song">406</span> charted in 1994.</li>
        <li>... 1970 had <span class="artist">423</span> different top performers; last year it was only <span class="artist">346</span>.
        </li>
        <li>... the 90s were the decade of a few mainstream bangers. Only <span class="artist">291</span> different artists charted in '92; an all-time low.</li>
